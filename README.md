# Tata iQ GenAI Powered Data Analytics - Financial Risk Strategy Consulting

This project simulates the role of an **AI Transformation Consultant** at Tata Insights and Quants (Tata iQ), focusing on leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) tools to design ethical and effective data-driven solutions in the financial services sector.

## 1. Project Context: Geldium Finance Delinquency Risk

**Client:** Geldium Finance, a financial services company facing a high rate of credit card delinquency (loan default risk).

**Strategic Objective:** To design a comprehensive, AI-powered solution to:
1.  Predict high-risk customers (delinquency prediction).
2.  Develop a responsible recommendation framework for the Head of Collections to determine optimal intervention strategies.
3.  Ensure the solution is **Ethical, Explainable, and Effective**.

## 2. Technical Stack & AI Methodology

**Tools Used:**
*   Generative AI Tools (e.g., Gemini AI, ChatGPT) - Used for prompt engineering, structured EDA, and report generation.
*   Modeling Concept: No-Code Predictive Modeling Framework (Focusing on logic and justification).
*   Deliverables: Word documents and PowerPoint presentation (PDF).

## 3. Detailed Tasks and Strategic Deliverables

| Task Focus | Strategic Output & GenAI Use | Key Skills Highlighted |
